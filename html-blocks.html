        Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a genius-level IQ but chooses to work as a janitor at MIT. 
        When he solves a difficult graduate-level math problem, his talents are discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), 
        who decides to help the misguided youth reach his potential. When Will is arrested for attacking a police officer, 
        Professor Lambeau makes a deal to get leniency for him if he will get treatment from therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams).
